## Summary of Findings

Most of the users are between the age of 20 and 45. Most trips start and end in the same day. Generally the busiest hours are between 7am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm, which is the business opening and closing hours of the day. Week days(Mondays to Fridays) are generally very busy with alot of trips, this might be due work and school activities, but weekends(Saturday and sunday) are characterized with longer ride durations, which might be due the fact that rides are usually taken for recreation on these days.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Despite fewer trips were made on weekends, trips made on weekends were longer as most probably they were enjoyed or uses as exercises. During weekdays, riders ride for a shorter time to a more define location like school and workplace.
Week days (between Monday and Friday) activities are high with the highest number of trips in a being on Thursday(19.3% of the weekly trips). A total of 16.5% of the trips were made on weekends(sunday and saturday). This reflects that most of the trips were made for Schooling and Working purposes and only a little made for recreational purposes.
